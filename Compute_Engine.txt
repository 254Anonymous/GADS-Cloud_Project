LAB1:Google Cloud Fundamentals: Getting Started with Compute Engine

Objectives:
	In this lab,we will learn how to perform the following tasks;
	a)Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the Google Cloud Platform(GCP)console
	b)Connect between the two instances

##STEPS:
1. Create a Virtual machine using the Google Cloud Platform (GCP)console
	
	gcloud compute instances create my-vm-1 --machine-type "n1-standard-1" --image-project "debian-cloud" --image "debian-9-stretch-v20200805" \
	
	--subnet "default" --tags http
	
	[Create firewall rules for the given virtual machine instance]
	
	gcloud compute firewall-rules create allow-http --action=ALLOW --destination=INGRESS --rules=http:80 --target-tags=http

2. Create a Virtual machine using the gcloud command line 

	#1.To display a list of all the zones in the region
	
	gcloud compute zones list | grep us-central-1

	#2.Choose a zone a zone from the list other than what's assigned and set it as the default zone
	
	gcloud config set compute/zone us-central1-b

	#3.Create a second virtual machine

	gcloud compute instances create my-vm-2 --machine-type "n1-standard-1" --image-project "debian-cloud" --image "debian-9-stretch-v20190213" \
	
	--subnet "default"

3. Connect between VM instances

	#1.Open SSH command prompt and use the ping command to confirm that my-vm-2 can reach my-vm-1 over the network

	-Connect to my-vm-2:
		gcloud compute ssh my-vm-2
	
	-ping my-vm-1 from my-vm-2:
		ping -c 3 my-vm-1

	-Use the ssh command to open a command prompt on my-vm-1:
		ssh my-vm-1

	-At the command prompt on my-vm-1, install the nginx web server:
		sudo apt-get install nginx-light -y

	-Use the nano text editor to create a custom message to the home page of the web server:
		sudo nano /var/www/html/index.nginx-debian.html

	-Moving your cursor to the h1 header,add text like this and replace YOUR_NAME with your name:
		Hi from YOUR_NAME

	-Exit the nano text editor and confirm that the web server is serving your new page.At the command prompt on my-vm-1 execute the command:
		curl http://localhost/
	#Outcome:
		The response will be the HTML source of the web server's home page,including your line of custom text 

	-To exit the command prompt on my-vm-1,execute the command:
		exit		(This will return the command prompt to my-vm-2)

	-To confirm that my-vm-2 can reach the web server on  my-vm-1,at the command prompt on my-vm-2,execute the command:
		curl http;//my-vm-1/ 
	#Outcome:
		The response will again be the HTML source of the web server's home pagee,including your line of cudtom text

	-Now get the ip address of my-vm-1 instance from this command:
		gcloud compute instances list

	-Copy the external ip of my-vm-1 and paste it into the address bar of a new browser tab
	#Outcome:
		You will see your web server's home page,including your custom text
