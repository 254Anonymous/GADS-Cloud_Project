LAB 2:Google Cloud Fundamentals: Getting Started with App Engine

Objectives:
	In this lab,you learn how to perform the following tasks:
	1)Initialize App Engine
	2)Preview an App Engine application running locally in cloud shell
	3)Deploy an App Engine application so others can reach it
	4)Disable an App Engine applcation,when you no longer want it to be visible

#Activate Google  Cloud Shell
	-You can list the active account name with the command:
		gcloud auth list

	#Output:
	ACTIVE ACCOUNT:
		student-03-610cfa8f7115@qwiklabs.net
	-You can list the project ID with this command:
		gcloud config list project

	#Output:
	[core]
	project = qwiklabs-gcp-03-f2eed20880d7

##STEPS:
1. Initialize App Engine:
	-Initialize your App Engine with your project and choose its region:
		gcloud app create --project = $DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID
	[When prompte,select the region where you want your App Engine application located]

	-Clone the source code repository for a sample application in the hello_world directory:
		git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/python_docs_samples

	-Navigate to the source repository
		cd python_docs_samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world

2. Run Hello World application locally:
	-Execute the following command to download and update the package list:
		sudo apt-get update

	-Set up a virtual environment in which you will run your application.Python virtual environments are used to isolate package installation from the system:
		sudo apt-get install virtualenv

		If prompted [Y/n],press Y and then Enter
	-Activate the virtual environment
		source/venv/bin/activate

	-Navigate to your project directory and install dependencies
		pip install -r requirements.txt

	-Run the application
		python main.py
		[Ignore the warnings if any]
	-In cloud shell,click Web Preview > Preview on  port 8080 to preview the application

	#Result:This displays the following
		Hello World!

	-To end the test,return to the cloud shell and press Ctr+c to terminate the process

	-Using the cloud console,verify that the app is not deployed in the cloud console,on the menu>App Engine>Dashboard

3. Deploy and Run Hello World on App Engine
	To deploy your application to the App Engine Standard environment;
	
	-Navigate to the resource directory:
		cd ~/python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world

	-Deploy your Hello World application
		gcloud app deploy
	[If prompted"Do You want to continue(Y/n)?",press Y and then Enter]
	This app deploy command uses the app.yaml file to identify project configuration

	-Launch your browser to view the app at http://YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com
		gcloud app browser
	[Copy and paste the URL into  a new browser window]
	#Result: The browser displays the following
		Hello World!

4. Disable the Application:

	 - In the cloud console, on the Navigatiion Menu,Click App Engine>Settings
	 -Click Disable application
	 -Read the dialogue message,Enter the App ID and click DISABLE
	 -On the command line:
		gcloud app disable qwiklabs-gcp-03-f2eed20880d7
